// Looping through an array (collection)
// However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if the index value or test condition
// is incorrect. For example, if you changed the definition of the a array to have four elements but forgot
// to update the condition to while index < 4, the code would panic. Itâ€™s also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code
// to perform the conditional check of whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration
// through the loop.

// The safety and conciseness of for loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust.
// Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example
// that used a while loop in Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a for loop. The way to do that would be to use a Range,
// provided by the standard library, which generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number
// and ending before another number.

// Hereâ€™s what the countdown would look like using a for loop and another method weâ€™ve not yet talked about, rev,
// to reverse the range:

fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}

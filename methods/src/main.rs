// Methods are similar to functions: we declare them with the fn keyword and a name,
// they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code thatâ€™s run when the method is called from somewhere else.
// Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in Chapters 6 and 17, respectively),
// and their first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
